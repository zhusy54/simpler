 *   - granular ChipSwimlaneLevel — `ChipSwimlaneDataHeader::chip_swimlane_level`
 *     (shared memory); read in `chip_swimlane_aicpu_init` and cached, then queried
 *     via `get_chip_swimlane_level()` for
 *     `>= AICPU_TIMING / SCHED_PHASES / ORCH_PHASES` gates.

/**
 * Pre-dispatch hook for AICore buffer rotation and per-pool stats.
 *
 * Called from the dispatch path (scheduler_dispatch in tensormap_and_ringbuffer,
 * aicpu_executor in host_build_graph) immediately BEFORE `write_reg(DATA_MAIN_BASE)`
 * for each AICore task. Two responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. Maintain the per-core AICPU-side dispatch count.
 *   2. Rotate the AICore buffer when the count is about to cross a
 *      PLATFORM_AICORE_BUFFER_SIZE boundary — publish the next buffer from
 *      free_queue to AICore and STASH the just-filled buffer for deferred,
 *      ACK-gated release (see chip_swimlane_aicpu_on_aicore_ack).
 *   3. Bump the AICore pool's `total_record_count` so host reconcile
 *      (total == collected + dropped) stays accurate at all levels —
 *      including AICORE_TIMING (level=1), where `complete_task` is bypassed.
 *
 * Race safety: rotation runs BEFORE the dispatch register write. The
 * completion-before-dispatch invariant proves prior tasks FIN'd, but
 * tensormap_and_ringbuffer may write FIN before the swimlane record, so the old
 * buffer's tail record may not have drained at rotation time. The old buffer is
 * therefore not enqueued here; it is released once AICore ACKs the boundary
 * dispatch (whose token is `reg_task_id`) or, when a runtime does not wire the
 * ACK hook, by the next-rotation / run-end backstop.
 *
 * No-op if chip_swimlane is disabled or `core_id` is out of range.

 * first-task ACK — hence passed the old buffer's last record dcci+dsb — so the
 * stashed buffer is enqueued to the ready queue. No-op when nothing is stashed
