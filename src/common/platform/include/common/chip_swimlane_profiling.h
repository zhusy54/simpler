 * AICore-side timing (start/end) all live in ChipSwimlaneAicoreTaskRecord; the
 * AICPU record only carries the two timestamps the AICore side cannot
 * produce, plus the host-side join key against the AICore stream.
 *
 *   - dispatch_time : AICPU timestamp when DATA_MAIN_BASE was written.
 *   - finish_time   : AICPU timestamp when AICPU observed FIN.
 *   - reg_task_id   : per-core monotonic dispatch token; join key against
 *                     ChipSwimlaneAicoreTaskRecord.reg_task_id.
 *
 * Host post-processing pulls task_token_raw + start_time + end_time from
 * the matched AICore record, derives core_type from the per-core static
 * table published via ChipSwimlaneCollector::set_core_types, and emits
 * func_id = -1 (resolved post-process by `swimlane_converter.py` from
 * deps.json's `kernel_ids[]`). Same path AICORE_TIMING (level=1) uses.
 *
 * Fanout edges live in the static DAG (deps.json from dep_gen) — not in
 * this record. Keeping fanout out of the hot AICPU commit path avoids a
 * per-task ~1 KB GM store + a linked-list walk on the scheduler's
 * critical fanin tail. `swimlane_converter.py` joins deps.json at
 * post-process time.
 *
 * Layout: 16B timing + 4B reg_task_id → 20B logical; `aligned(32)` rounds
 * the struct size up to 32B (compiler-inserted trailing pad) and forces
 * 32B placement alignment so each record sits in one half of a 64B cache
 * line. Two records per cache line.

// ChipSwimlaneAicoreTaskRecord - Slim AICore-Only Record (written by AICore, read by Host)
// =============================================================================

/**
 * Slim per-task record written by AICore directly into its own per-core
 * output buffer (no staging slot, no AICPU read). AICPU never touches this
 * record at AICORE_TIMING (level=1); at AICPU_TIMING+ the host joins it
 * against the AICPU record stream on `reg_task_id` (NOT `task_token_raw`).
 *
 * Two identity fields with different roles:
 *
 * - `task_token_raw` — the PTO2 task identity `(ring_id << 32) | local_id`.
 *   Per-task unique. AICore reads it from
 *   `LocalContext.async_ctx.task_token.raw` (already in the dispatch
 *   payload's cache line). The host pulls it from here as the canonical
 *   task id + ring decoder at ALL levels — the AICPU record carries no
 *   identity after the slim-down (only dispatch/finish timestamps and the
 *   reg_task_id join key), so AICore is the single source of truth for
 *   task identity. NOT a join key on its own: SPMD `block_num > num_cores`,
 *   MIX cluster spread, and pipeline dual-issue all dispatch the same
 *   `task_token_raw` multiple times to the same core, each producing one
 *   AICore execution record sharing the same token. The host disambiguates
 *   by `reg_task_id` below.
 *
 * - `reg_task_id` — the per-core dispatch token (low 32 bits of the
 *   per-core monotonic `dispatch_seq`). Per-dispatch unique within a core.
 *   At level≥2 the host uses this as the join key against the AICPU
 *   record stream's `ChipSwimlaneAicpuTaskRecord.reg_task_id`. Each dispatch
 *   produces one AICore record + one AICPU record sharing the same
 *   reg_task_id, giving a clean 1:1 join even when multiple dispatches
 *   of the same task land on the same core.
 *
 * Layout: 24B identity/timing + 4B reg_task_id + 4B receive_to_start delta →
 * 32B (half a cache line). Two records pack into one cache line so AICore's
 * per-task store is at most a single line commit + dcci.
 *
 * receive_to_start_cycles isolates the AICore-side dcci+ack cost from the
 * AICPU→AICore NoC propagation. AICore captures receive_time right after
 * `read_reg(DATA_MAIN_BASE)` returns the new task_id (before dcci+ack), and
 * start_time after them. Host derives:
 *   - receive_time  = start_time - receive_to_start_cycles
 *   - propagation   = receive_time - dispatch_ts (AICPU view)
 *   - local_setup   = receive_to_start_cycles    (dcci + ack)
 * Delta fits in 32 bits on all supported platforms (minimum wrap window
 * is approximately 4.3 s at the fastest 1 GHz counter).

/**
 * Single cache-line head describing the per-pool active buffer.
 *
 * Shared by all four pool kinds (AicpuTask / AicpuSchedPhase / AicpuOrchPhase / AicoreTask). The
 * field set is intentionally uniform — every pool needs:
 *   - current_buf_ptr      : device address of the buffer the producer is
 *                            currently writing into (0 = no active buffer)
 *   - current_buf_seq      : monotonic sequence number; bumped on every
 *                            rotation. For AICore this doubles as the
 *                            "generation" the per-core local state compares
 *                            against to detect a rotation.
 *   - total_record_count   : producer-maintained tally; host cross-checks at
 *                            end-of-run that `collected + dropped == total`.
 *   - dropped_record_count : producer-maintained tally; counts records lost
 *                            (free_queue empty / overwrite / no buffer).
 *
 * Single-writer (AICPU) for every pool; readers are either AICore (via dcci
 * SINGLE_CACHE_LINE, AicoreTask pool only) or the host at drain time. Because
 * AICore only reads current_buf_ptr/current_buf_seq and invalidates the whole
 * line, the cohabiting counter fields are harmless — AICore never reads them.
 *
 * Race avoidance for AicoreTask pools: AICPU rotates strictly before
 * `write_reg(DATA_MAIN_BASE)` for the first task of a new BUFFER_SIZE batch.
 * The runtime's completion-before-dispatch invariant (AICore is single-
 * threaded per core and AICPU does not dispatch task K+1 until K FIN'd)
 * guarantees all prior tasks have FIN'd at rotation time, so AICore has
 * already finished writing their records (and dcci'd them out) into the
 * old buffer before AICPU enqueues it to ready_queue.

// AICPU Phase Profiling - Scheduler and Orchestrator Records
// =============================================================================
//
// Two record types route through two distinct BufferKinds (AicpuSchedPhase /
// AicpuOrchPhase) into two distinct per-thread pool arrays. Each side carries
// only the fields it actually uses — no union, no magic phase_id range gate
// at parse time.
//
// Sched records: one per work-emitting phase per scheduler loop iteration.
//   Idle iterations do not emit; host tooling reconstructs idle spans from
//   gaps between consecutive sched records on the same thread
//   (see swimlane_converter.py / sched_overhead_analysis.py).
//
// Orch records: one per submit_task() / alloc_tensors() call captures the
//   entire submit's [start, end] wall-clock window. Per-sub-step cycle
//   splits live in the device cold-path log as cumulative counters
//   (`g_orch_*_cycle`) — they answer "which sub-step dominates overall";
//   the per-submit envelope answers "which submit was slow".

/** Discriminator for the SCHED phase records (the orch side has no kind).
 *
 * Three role classes, but they share one enum so the on-device record carries
 * a single discriminator byte:
 *
 *   OUTER (mutually time-exclusive within an iter; emit advances _t0_phase):
 *     Complete, Dispatch, Release, Dummy, EarlyDispatch.
 *     Every iter is a sequence of zero-or-more outer bars + optional gap.
 *
 *   INNER (no anchor advance; Perfetto auto-nests by time containment):
 *     Resolve. Only parents are Complete and Dummy — those are the two
 *     FIN-observation sites that call on_task_complete.
 *
 *   SEPARATE-LANE (converter routes to Worker View pid=4, not the sched lane):
 *     DummyTask and PredicatedSkip. One zero-width marker per dependency-only
 *     completion keeps the DAG node visible on its handling AICPU's lane; the
 *     surrounding Dummy outer bar (sched lane) carries the actual drain time,
 *     and Resolve inside that bar carries the consumer-release work.
