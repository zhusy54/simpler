/**
 * Onboard host `DeviceRunnerBase` — common base class for a2a3 and a5
 * onboard `DeviceRunner`s.
 *
 * This module owns the host-side state and methods that are identical
 * between the two onboard arches today:
 *   - The `MemoryAllocator` and the three `DeviceArena`s (gm heap, PTO2
 *     SM, runtime arena) backing the per-Worker pooled regions.
 *   - The trivial tensor-memory wrappers (`allocate_tensor`,
 *     `free_tensor`, `copy_*_device`).
 *   - The arena-pool accessors (`acquire_pooled_gm_heap`, etc.).
 *   - Device lifecycle: `attach_current_thread`,
 *     `configure_aicore_op_timeout`, `ensure_device_initialized`,
 *     `ensure_binaries_loaded`, persistent AICPU/AICore streams,
 *     dispatcher/executor bytes, `LoadAicpuOp`, `KernelArgsHelper`.
 *   - block_dim resolution: `query_max_block_dim`, `resolve_block_dim`.
 *   - Debug: `print_handshake_results`, `create_thread`.
 *
 * Subclasses (`{a2a3,a5}::DeviceRunner`) add arch-specific state
 * (callable registry, profiling collectors, ACL/HCCL plumbing on a2a3,
 * `enable_*` flags) and the divergent methods (`prepare_execution`,
 * `launch_execution`, `poll_execution`, `drain_execution`, `finalize`,
 * `setup_static_arena`, the kernel launch /
 * chip-callable upload, the per-callable registration helpers, and the
 * per-diagnostic `init_*`).
