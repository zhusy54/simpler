/**
 * Compile-time upper bound on the number of AICPU threads CANN may
 * start per launch. The actual launch count is runtime-derived:
 * the host topology probe sets runtime.aicpu_launch_count =
 * popcount(OCCUPY), and DeviceRunner passes that count (not this
 * constant) to rtsLaunchCpuKernel.
 *
 * The bound sizes the per-launched-thread phase/task-timing storage and rejects
 * a runtime launch population beyond the supported A5 topology. The common
 * affinity gate has its own ABI bound, MAX_GATE_THREADS=16; keep this platform
 * limit at or below that independent common bound.
 *
 * Two over-subscription failure modes to keep in mind when choosing
 * the runtime launch count vs this bound:
 *   1. "Duplicate drop after barrier" — happens when CANN over-fills
 *      a subset of OCCUPY cpus (duplicates land on the sink cpu).
 *      The filter gate first barriers all launched threads, then
 *      classifies cpu_id and drops the duplicates (only the first
 *      thread to land on each ALLOWED slot survives). Safe.
 *   2. "Barrier never closes" — happens when launch_count exceeds
 *      popcount(OCCUPY) on the production AICPU kernel: contended
 *      init paths on the over-subscribed sink prevent some threads
 *      from reaching the barrier publish counter, the wait spins
 *      forever, and CANN reports aclrtSynchronizeStream rc=507000
 *      after the stream timeout. This is the reason the runtime
 *      uses popcount(OCCUPY) rather than this constant.
 *
 * Current value 14 = worst-case popcount(OCCUPY) on the Ascend950PR
 * 0x7ffe SKU (7 phys × 2 SMT = 14 user logical cpus). See
 * src/a5/docs/hardware.md "CANN AICPU thread dispatch" for the
