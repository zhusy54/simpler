/**
 * @file aicore_profiling_state.h
 * @brief AICore-side per-core profiling state set/get interface.
 *
 * Mirrors the AICPU-side `set_chip_swimlane_enabled` / `set_pmu_enabled` /
 * etc. setters: the platform owns a per-core slot for profiling state,
 * populated once by the AICore kernel entry from `KernelArgs`, and read by
 * `aicore_execute` via getters. Runtime never touches the underlying
 * storage, so adding profiling fields does not change `aicore_execute`'s
 * signature or the runtime's `Handshake` struct.
 *
 * Storage backend:
 *   - onboard: `[[block_local]]` static variables in aicore/kernel.cpp
 *   - sim:     pthread TLS in aicore/kernel.cpp
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. Host fills `KernelArgs::enable_profiling_flag`,
 *      `KernelArgs::chip_swimlane_aicore_rotation_table` (an array of per-core
 *      slots, each holding a device address of an `ChipSwimlaneActiveHead`),
 *      `KernelArgs::aicore_pmu_ring_addrs` (a5-only — PMU staging slots),
 *      and `regs` (the per-physical-core register-base array).
 *      Host allocates the table bytes; AICPU populates the chip swimlane slot
 *      entries inside `chip_swimlane_aicpu_init` with `&pool.head` for each
 *      AicoreTask pool.
 *   2. AICore kernel entry stashes `&chip_swimlane_aicore_rotation_table[block_idx]`
 *      (the slot pointer — NOT the dereferenced head pointer yet) via
 *      `set_chip_swimlane_aicore_head_slot()`, resolves its own PMU MMIO base
 *      from `regs[physical_core_id]`, and calls the PMU setters, before
 *      invoking `aicore_execute`.
 *   3. `get_chip_swimlane_aicore_head()` lazily dereferences the slot the
 *      first time it is called. Callers must defer the call until AFTER
 *      AICPU has dispatched the first task (so AICPU init has had a chance
 *      to populate the table). The executor handles this by calling it
 *      inside the main loop's first-task branch.
 *
 * a5 specifics: PMU on a5 is AICore-side (AICore reads MMIO + writes the
 * staging slot), so a5 carries an extra `pmu_ring` + `pmu_reg_base` pair
 * that a2a3 does not have.
