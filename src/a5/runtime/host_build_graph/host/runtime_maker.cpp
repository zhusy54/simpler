/**
 * Runtime Builder - rt2 Implementation (host_build_graph: Host Orchestration)
 *
 * Provides init_runtime_impl and validate_runtime_impl functions for rt2 runtime.
 * The HOST runs the orchestrator to completion, populates shared memory + the
 * prebuilt arena, and H2Ds the image; the device boots scheduler-only.
 *
 * init_runtime_impl:
 *   - Converts host tensor pointers to device pointers (all inputs copied H2D;
 *     only OUTPUT/INOUT tensors are copied back D2H)
 *   - dlopens the orchestration SO on the host and runs it to build the graph
 *   - Sets up runtime state for host orchestration
 *
 * validate_runtime_impl:
 *   - Copies OUTPUT/INOUT tensors back from device to host (read-only inputs
 *     are skipped)
 *   - Frees device memory

// once per page, and the bind maps its shared-memory mirror and arenas per call, so
// a phase's fault count is what separates work from page-table cost — a count, so it

// `ru_utime`/`ru_stime` are accounted per scheduler tick, 10 ms at CLK_TCK=100, so on
// a phase of a millisecond they quantise to either zero or a whole tick and no split
// survives. A per-thread clock reads the scheduler's running total in nanoseconds.
//
// Two CPU figures, because a phase runs on more than one thread. `cpu_ns` is the bind
// thread's own, so a phase's `dur - cpu_ns` is the time that thread spent off CPU;
// `recorder_cpu_ns` is every recording worker's summed, so its ratio to `dur` is how
// many threads' worth of work ran alongside. Only the first can be subtracted from the
