/**
 * Runtime Builder - host_build_graph Host Orchestration
 *
 * Provides init_runtime_impl and validate_runtime_impl functions for the host_build_graph runtime.
 * The HOST runs the orchestrator to completion, uploads the compact shared-memory
 * image, and publishes the scheduler state.
 *
 * init_runtime_impl:
 *   - Converts host tensor pointers to device pointers (all inputs copied H2D;
 *     only OUTPUT/INOUT tensors are copied back D2H)
 *   - dlopens the orchestration SO on the host and runs it to build the graph
 *   - Sets up runtime state for host orchestration
 *
 * validate_runtime_impl:
 *   - Copies OUTPUT/INOUT tensors back from device to host (read-only inputs
 *     are skipped)
 *   - Frees device memory
