# host_build_graph Runtime build configuration
# All paths are relative to this file's directory (src/runtime/host_build_graph/)
#
# The host materializes the graph and uploads a read-only view. AICore workers
# resolve dependencies and execute kernels. AICPU participates only in worker
# initialization, run completion waiting, and teardown.
#
# The "orchestration" directory contains source files compiled into both
# runtime targets AND the orchestration .so (e.g., tensor methods needed
# by the ChipTensor constructor's validation logic). Nothing in it may create host
# threads, because the aicore and aicpu targets compile it too: the Graph recorder pool
# therefore lives in a "host" directory (common/host_build_graph/host/graph_recorder_pool.cpp),
# which only the host target builds, and the orchestration .so reaches it through the
# ops table.
#
# src/common/host_build_graph holds the sources shared with the other architecture.
# Its .cpp files sit under a "host", "device" or "shared" subdirectory naming the
# targets that compile them, because every source_dirs entry is collected by a
# recursive glob: "host" code uses the STL containers the AICPU target forbids, so it
# has to live outside any directory that target names. Headers stay flat there.
#
# That directory is also on every target's include path, which is what lets the
# runtime-agnostic platform and worker sources reach this runtime's runtime.h and
# types.h by bare name: they resolve here when compiled for host_build_graph and to
# tensormap_and_ringbuffer's own copies when compiled for that runtime. "runtime"
# precedes it, so an arch-local header still wins over a shared one of the same name.
