/**
 * @file dispatch_payload.h
 * @brief Per-core dispatch payload for AICore kernel execution
 *
 * DispatchPayload holds the kernel function address, a per-core args[]
 * array, and embedded SPMD context (LocalContext + GlobalContext).  AICPU
 * maintains a static array of these (one per core).
 *
 * GlobalContext (sub_block_id) is populated by the scheduler path. The legacy
 * scheduler seeds each per-core slot at startup; resident graph materialization
 * writes the selected task subslot before every dispatch publication.
 *
 * build_payload() refreshes the function address, LocalContext's hot fields,
 * and either the ready-path argument prefix or the gated-path source pointer.
 * Context pointers and async-completion slab metadata are initialized once per
 * core and payload buffer.
 *
 * AICore caches a pointer to its per-core slot at startup and reads from
 * it on each dispatch.  The struct is cache-line aligned to avoid false
 * sharing across concurrently dispatched cores.
 *
 * The DATA_MAIN_BASE register protocol is unchanged from the base runtime:
 * a monotonically increasing reg_task_id signals new work to AICore.
