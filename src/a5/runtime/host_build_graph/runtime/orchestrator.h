/**
 * Orchestrator interface
 *
 * The Orchestrator is responsible for:
 * 1. Executing the orchestration function (Turing-complete control flow)
 * 2. Allocating intermediate buffers from the heap
 * 3. Submitting tasks via async InCore function calls
 * 4. Building the dependency graph using TensorMap
 * 5. Tracking scope nesting, which selects TensorMap or explicit dependencies
 *
 * The Orchestrator can run on either:
 * - Host CPU (lower latency for complex control, easier debugging)
 * - Device AI_CPU (lower latency for task submission)
 *
 * Based on: docs/RUNTIME_LOGIC.md
