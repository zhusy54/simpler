# host_build_graph Runtime build configuration
# All paths are relative to this file's directory (src/runtime/host_build_graph/)
#
# This is the host-orchestration variant of tensormap_and_ringbuffer: it shares
# the same scheduler, ring buffers, and shared-memory layout, differing only in
# WHEN the orchestrator runs.
# - Host runs the orchestrator to completion, populating SM + arena, then H2Ds
#   the image to device (vs tensormap, where AICPU thread N-1 orchestrates on
#   device concurrently with the scheduler threads)
# - AICPU threads 0..N-1 all run schedulers (no on-device orchestrator thread)
# - AICore executes tasks via an aligned PTO2DispatchPayload + pre-built dispatch_args
#
# The "orchestration" directory contains source files compiled into both
# runtime targets AND the orchestration .so (e.g., tensor methods needed
# by the ChipTensor constructor's validation logic).
