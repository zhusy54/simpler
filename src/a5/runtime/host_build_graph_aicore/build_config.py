# host_build_graph_aicore Runtime build configuration
# All paths are relative to this file's directory (src/runtime/host_build_graph/)
#
# The host materializes the graph and uploads a read-only view. AICore workers
# classify tasks, resolve dependencies, and execute kernels. AICPU participates
# only in worker initialization, run completion waiting, and teardown.
#
# The "orchestration" directory contains source files compiled into both
# runtime targets AND the orchestration .so (e.g., tensor methods needed
# by the ChipTensor constructor's validation logic).
