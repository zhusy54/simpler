/**
 * @file dep_gen_host_graph.h
 * @brief dep_gen capture for host_build_graph — the dependency graph as the
 *        host orchestrator actually builds it.
 *
 * host_build_graph runs the whole orchestration on the host before any
 * scheduler thread starts, so every submit_task and every tensormap hit is
 * observable in-process, in order, with nothing to lose: the graph is recorded
 * from the real dependency path (`compute_task_fanin`'s emit/annotate hooks),
 * not reconstructed from a captured input stream. That is the difference from
 * tensormap_and_ringbuffer, where the orchestrator runs on the AICPU and the
 * host can only replay a ring of captured submits.
 *
 * Capture surface:
 *   begin_capture()         — once per orchestration, from run_host_orchestration
 *   begin_task()            — one per submit, before its dependency steps
 *   add_explicit_edge()     — STEP 1, per declared dependency
 *   add_creator_edge()      — STEP 3 Step A, per creator-retention producer
 *   add_tensormap_edge()    — STEP 3 Step B, per tensormap producer
 *   end_task()              — closes the task, after its last dependency step
 *
 * Control surface, called from the device runner (same host_runtime.so):
 *   set_enabled() / active() / take_capture() / adopt_capture() / emit()
 *
 * The runtime translation unit links weak no-op fallbacks (pto_orchestrator.cpp)
 * so the AICPU build, which has no host graph, resolves without this .cpp.
 *
 * The graph is per-thread state while it is being built. After bind, prepare
 * moves the completed graph into run-owned storage; launch adopts that snapshot
 * into the progress thread's local state before enqueue, and drain emits it.
 * This keeps capture lock-free while allowing serialized lifecycle calls to
 * use different host threads and preventing two prepared contexts on one
 * thread from overwriting one another.
 *
 * Per-task producer dedup mirrors PTO2FaninBuilder, which keys on (ring, slot);
 * this keys on producer task id. The two agree only because host_build_graph is
 * whole-graph-resident and never reuses a task slot at build time (see
 * append_fanin_or_fail in pto_orchestrator.cpp). A runtime that recycles slots
 * mid-build would need this key revisited.
 *
 * Output is `deps.json` in the schema documented in docs/dfx/dep-gen.md — the
 * same schema the tensormap_and_ringbuffer replay emits, so every downstream
 * consumer (deps viewer, swimlane join) reads both runtimes' output the same way.
