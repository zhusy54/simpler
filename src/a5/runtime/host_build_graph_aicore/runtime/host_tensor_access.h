/**
 * @file host_tensor_access.h
 * @brief ChipTensor-byte access for the host orchestrator, over device buffers.
 *
 * `ChipTensor::buffer.addr` is a device address. host_build_graph runs the
 * orchestrator on the host, so `get_tensor_data` / `set_tensor_data` cannot
 * assume the CPU executing them can load that address — whether it can is a
 * platform capability, not a property of the runtime. This is the seam where
 * that capability is resolved, so the orchestrator core never dereferences a
 * device address itself.
 *
 * A region is registered per staged tensor with the host address serving it:
 *
 *   - `host_view == dev_base`  — the device buffer is mapped into the host
 *     address space (a2a3 `halHostRegister(DEV_SVM_MAP_HOST)`; sim, where a
 *     device pointer is already a host pointer). Reads and writes land on the
 *     device bytes directly.
 *   - `host_view != dev_base`  — no host mapping exists. The region is served
 *     from the staging buffer holding the same bytes, and a write is pushed
 *     back through the device-copy hook so the device observes it.
 *
 * An address no registered region covers is a failure, never a raw
 * dereference: only tensors the runtime staged have a host view at all, so a
 * GM-heap tensor or a pass-through child-memory buffer resolves to nothing.
 *
 * Registrations are owned by one orchestration run — the window between
 * staging and the first dispatched task. A mirror is a copy, and nothing has
 * executed yet to make it stale; once tasks run, a stale mirror would be
 * indistinguishable from live device memory. `HostTensorAccessor` bounds that
 * window and releases its mappings on every exit path.
 *
 * The read/write pair carries weak fallbacks in the runtime translation unit
 * (`orchestrator_core/pto_runtime2.cpp`) that dereference `dev_addr` directly,
 * so the AICPU build — which compiles this path but never runs an
 * orchestrator — resolves without this .cpp. libhost_runtime.so links the
 * strong definitions from `host/host_tensor_access.cpp`.

/**
 * The registered regions of one orchestration run, and the mappings that run
 * installed to serve them.
 *
 * One accessor per run, mutated only by the thread running that run's
 * orchestration. The region and mapping tables are plain vectors with no lock,
 * so concurrent `add` / `close` on one accessor is a data race; concurrent runs
 * are isolated by each owning a separate accessor, which is what makes two runs
 * unable to see or drop each other's regions.
 *
 * `add` is the only producer of mappings and the only caller of
 * `register_device_memory_to_host`; `close` unregisters exactly the mappings
 * this accessor installed and nothing else. Both are reached on every return
 * path — `close` is idempotent and the destructor calls it — so a mapping
 * cannot outlive the run that made it.
 *
 * A null `api` makes every `add` fail, so a registered region always implies a
 * usable `api`; `write`'s mirror push-back relies on that and does not re-check.
 *
 * The state lives behind `Impl` because this header is also compiled by the
 * AICPU build (through `orchestrator_core/pto_runtime2.cpp`, which resolves the
 * weak read/write fallbacks below), and that build has no `<vector>`. Keep the
 * standard containers in `host/host_tensor_access.cpp`.
