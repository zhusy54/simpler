/**
 * A recording builds its Definition image directly into the arena the bind hands
 * the host state — the retained host staging its objects are uploaded from — so
 * the upload ships what the recorders wrote instead of copying it. Two properties
 * make that safe, and each is invisible from the scene tests, which pass either
 * way:
 *
 *   - the placement contract: object offsets are aligned and disjoint, and the
 *     claimed prefix covers every one of them, because the upload derives the
 *     region it ships from that prefix alone;
 *   - the fallback: a run the retained capacity cannot hold still publishes a
 *     valid image, in a buffer of its own, so outgrowing the arena costs a copy
 *     rather than the run.
