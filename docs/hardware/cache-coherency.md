# Cache Coherency (GM ↔ AICore/AICPU)

This page is the authoritative reference for **when to insert a cache
operation** on Ascend onboard hardware. The coherency model differs
between chip generations supported in this repo: a2a3 requires AICPU
cache maintenance for host-DMA and SDMA-published GM, while a5 AICPU
loads are coherent with DMA/HBM and do not need those invalidates.
Cycle costs and a few code-path examples below are sampled on a2a3
unless stated otherwise. Misapplying these rules either leaks stale data
(correctness bug) or burns a `dsb sy` per record on a hot path (perf
bug — see PR #863 lineage). Read it before touching any code that
writes `dc civac`, `dc cvac`, `cache_invalidate_range`, or any `dcci`
on AICore.

## Who shares GM, and with what consistency

GM (HBM) is read and written by four parties on Ascend onboard. Their
relationship to **AICPU's data cache** is **not symmetric** on a2a3,
and a5 has a stronger DMA/HBM coherency model:

| Writer | a2a3: AICPU sees write automatically? | a2a3: AICPU must invalidate before read? | a5: AICPU must invalidate before read? |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| AICPU itself | Yes (own cache) | No | No |
| **AICore** (AIC / AIV / MIX) | **Yes** | **No** | **No** |
| Host DMA (`rtMemcpy` from host RAM) | No | **Yes** | **No** |
| SDMA engine (device-side DMA) | No (assumed) | **Yes** | **No** |

Likewise, **AICore's own cache is non-coherent with GM** in the other
direction: AICore-side writes stay in its data cache until explicitly
pushed out with `dcci`. AICPU writes that AICore needs to see follow a
mirror of this table (AICore must `dcci` to invalidate before reading
host- or AICPU-written GM).

The rest of this doc fills in why each row of the table is what it is,
and what code lives on each side.

### AICore-to-AICore data is access-path specific

Do not infer a whole-kernel cache operation merely because two scheduled tasks
have a dependency. Tensor operands consumed through the Tensor/MTE load path do
not require an AICore data-cache invalidation. In contrast, ordinary scalar LSU
loads and stores use the AICore data cache: a producer must clean the exact
written lines with `dcci(..., SINGLE_CACHE_LINE, CACHELINE_OUT)` followed by one
`dsb`, and a consumer must invalidate those exact lines before loading them,
again followed by one `dsb`. Independent writers must use separate cache lines.

The A5 `host_build_graph` scheduler therefore performs cache maintenance only
for scheduler-owned metadata and dispatch payloads. It does not issue a final
whole-data-cache invalidation around every kernel. Kernels that communicate via
scalar LSU GM accesses own their precise observe/publish protocol; Tensor/MTE
data remains outside that protocol.

## The two cache primitives

| Primitive | Side | Purpose | Cost (rough, a2a3 / DAV_3510) |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `dcci` (`__attribute__((aicore))` intrinsic) | AICore | Push a cache line out to GM (clean+invalidate). Required after AICore stores that AICPU or peer AICore must read. | 1 cache line per call + a following `dsb` to commit ordering. |
| `cache_invalidate_range(addr, size)` (`src/common/platform/include/aicpu/cache_maintenance.h`) | AICPU | `dc civac` + `dsb sy` + `isb` over a byte range on onboard builds; sim builds keep it a no-op. Required on a2a3 before AICPU reads GM that **a non-coherent writer** (host DMA, SDMA) most recently published. | `dsb sy` dominates (tens to hundreds of cycles, fixed regardless of range). |

`cache_invalidate_range` is the protocol-correct primitive for the
**host-DMA → AICPU** case on a2a3. It was introduced in PR #204
specifically for `Runtime` struct hand-off where the host writes via
`rtMemcpy` and AICPU reads. **It is NOT the right primitive for
AICore → AICPU, and it is not required for a5 DMA/HBM reads.**

### `dcci` is whole-cache-line: no parallel sub-line writes

`dcci` cleans+invalidates **one whole cache line** (64 B on a2a3 = 16
`float`s); there is no sub-line granularity. A core's writeback emits its
entire line copy, including bytes it never wrote (stale in its copy).

**Consequence — two AICore cores must never write different elements of the
same cache line in parallel.** Each core flushes the whole line, so the last
flush clobbers the others' elements with stale values (classic false
sharing → last-writer-wins). This is invisible on `sim` (cache modeled as
no-op: `SINGLE_CACHE_LINE == 0` in `platform/sim/aicore/inner_kernel.h`) and
only fails on silicon. The kernel-author rule (each SPMD block writes its own
cache line) lives in
[../aicore-kernel-programming.md](../aicore-kernel-programming.md#each-block-must-write-to-its-own-cache-line).

## The "AICore → AICPU" path: AICPU does not invalidate, but DOES barrier

AICore and AICPU share a coherency domain on GM. When AICore writes a
slot, the correct handshake is:

```text
AICore                              AICPU
  store slot fields                   read COND (MMIO, Device-nGnRE)
  store task_id (last)                check FIN bit
  dcci slot, SINGLE_CACHE_LINE   →    rmb()                ← load-load barrier
  dsb (commit dcci before FIN)        read slot fields     ← Normal cacheable
  write FIN → COND                ←
```

Two separate concerns, often conflated:

- **Cache coherency** (Do we need `dc civac`?): No. AICore's `dcci`
  pushes the line to GM and the AICPU's cache is in the same coherency
  domain, so a subsequent AICPU load fetches the fresh value. `dcci`
  is load-bearing on AICore's side — AICore's data cache is not
  coherent with GM in the other direction, so without `dcci` the line
  never reaches HBM and AICPU would observe an old value.

- **Load-load ordering** (Do we need `rmb()`?): **Yes.** The COND
  register is `Device-nGnRE` memory; the slot is Normal cacheable
  memory. ARM64 does not implicitly order Device reads against
  subsequent Normal reads — they can be reordered if there is no
  data/address dependency. In this path, the slot address is computed
  from a value the caller already holds (the dispatched `task_id`),
  not from the just-read COND value, so there is no architectural
  dependency. Without `rmb()` (`dsb ld`), the CPU can speculatively
  satisfy the slot load before the COND read indicates FIN, returning
  whatever was in the AICPU's cache at speculation time (likely a
  stale value from a previous round). The AICPU side must emit
  `rmb()` between the COND check and the slot reads.

Concretely, the chip swimlane staging-slot read in
`src/common/platform/shared/aicpu/chip_swimlane_collector_aicpu.cpp` does
**not** call `cache_invalidate_range` on the slot, but it **does** call
`rmb()` before reading `slot->task_id` and the timing fields. All of
those fields are AICore writes covered by the AICore-side `dcci` in
`chip_swimlane_aicore_record_task`. The same pattern applies to the PMU
staging slot
(`src/{a2a3,a5}/platform/shared/aicpu/pmu_collector_aicpu.cpp`).

### Historical pitfall

PR #540 (2026-04-15) added `cache_invalidate_range(slot, 64)` on the
AICPU side of the chip swimlane staging slot, mirroring the
host-DMA-protocol pattern from PR #204. The two situations are
**not** the same: host DMA bypasses the AICPU cache; AICore stores
plus `dcci` do not. The cache invalidate was redundant — but the
embedded `dsb sy` inside `cache_invalidate_range` was inadvertently
providing the COND→slot load-load ordering as a side effect. Replacing
the whole call with nothing would have left the ordering implicit (and
dependent on microarchitectural quirks); replacing it with an explicit
`rmb()` keeps the ordering as part of the documented protocol while
dropping the unnecessary cache op.

If you find yourself about to write `cache_invalidate_range` on an
AICPU-side read of an AICore-published value, **stop**. The right fix
is `rmb()` (for load-load ordering against a prior COND read) plus
making sure the AICore side does `dcci` before signaling. The cache
invalidate itself is not needed on this path.

## The "host DMA → AICPU" path: a2a3 MUST invalidate, a5 does not

On a2a3, when the host writes via `rtMemcpy`, the AICPU cache is not snooped.
A cached value from a previous round survives the DMA write, so the
next AICPU load returns stale data. The original PR #204 fix was:

```cpp
// src/a2a3/runtime/host_build_graph/aicpu/aicpu_executor.cpp
cache_invalidate_range(runtime, sizeof(Runtime));  // before reading host-written Runtime
```

This is **necessary on a2a3** and must not be removed there. It is the
load-bearing usage of `cache_invalidate_range` in the a2a3 runtime.

On a5, host DMA writes to GM are coherent with AICPU reads, so the
matching runtime hand-off code does not call `cache_invalidate_range`.

## The "SDMA → AICPU" path: a2a3 is conservative, a5 is coherent

SDMA is a separate device-side DMA engine. On a2a3 it writes GM but is
not known to snoop AICPU's data cache. Current a2a3 runtime code (see
`src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/backend/sdma/sdma_completion_scheduler.h`
and the SDMA-engine async-wait completion path in
`src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/async_wait.h` and
`src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/scheduler/scheduler.h`)
**does** invalidate before reading SDMA-written counters and records,
on the conservative assumption that SDMA is not in AICPU's coherency
domain.

On a5, SDMA writes are coherent with AICPU reads, so the matching a5
SDMA completion helpers do not invalidate or flush cache lines.

## Quick decision table

When you are about to insert a cache operation, ask in order:

1. Who actually wrote the bytes I'm reading? Look at the producer
   code, not the address.
2. Is this a5? If yes → no AICPU invalidate/flush for GM reads written
   by host DMA, SDMA, AICPU, or AICore.
3. On a2a3, is the producer in the AICPU coherency domain (AICPU itself
   or AICore)? If yes → no invalidate. If no (host, SDMA) → invalidate.
4. For AICore writes specifically, does the producer already `dcci`
   before signaling? If not, fix that instead of papering over it
   with an AICPU-side invalidate.
5. Did I just read a completion flag (COND / mailbox / counter) from
   a different memory type (Device-nGnRE MMIO) before this load? If
   yes, and there is no data/address dependency between that read and
   this one, insert `rmb()` between them — coherency does not imply
   load-load ordering on ARM64.
6. Is this an AICore consuming another AICore's data? If it is Tensor/MTE
   traffic, do not add a D-cache operation. If it is scalar LSU traffic,
   invalidate/publish only the exact cache lines in the kernel contract.

If the answer to (1) is "I'm not sure" — find out. The cost of one
wrong `cache_invalidate_range` is silent perf rot; the cost of a
missing `rmb()` is a stale-data bug that may only fire under specific
buffer-reuse patterns or aggressive OOO speculation. Both are paid
forever once they ship.
